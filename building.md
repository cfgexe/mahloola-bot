## Note: this assumes you have already downloaded the source code
because the token file is gitignored (for obvious reasons) you will have to make a file called 'auth.json' and put your token in it.
then install node.js and open command prompt, then run 'npm i' in the source code folder.
finally, type 'node index.js' also in the main source code folder.
then, you will have mahloola bot running on your bot.
